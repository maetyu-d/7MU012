## The Alpaca Sessions

As part of his No Bounds residency, Alex McLean puts together this online live series of producers who are pushing algorithmic patterns forward through sound. As well as performing widely (including at No Bounds) Alex co-founded the Algorave movement and created the popular free/open source live coding system TidalCycles. These Alpaca sessions will showcase those using TidalCycles and similar algorithmic music platforms to look beyond stylism, instead using algorithms to restructure music, building on the ancient tradition of pattern making.

##  FULL PINK MOON: Opera Povera from Quarantine

Opera Povera presents FULL PINK MOON: Opera Povera in Quarantine, an international durational livestream performance of visionary composer Pauline Oliveros’ open-form The Lunar Opera; Deep Listening For_Tunes.

Featuring an inclusive and collaborative score by Oliveros, Full Pink Moon allows each performer to actively determine all creative choices: when and how to perform, choose cues, characters, costumes, and props, and harness creative performance power to reach out and share with each other in a time of separation and quarantine with a collective structure that Oliveros defined as “dedicated to tolerance and freedom.”

This event was created by Sean Griffin, founder of Opera Povera and a collaborator of Oliveros, and Los Angeles musician and producer Madeline Falcone, as an artistic and financial call to arms against the COVID-19 pandemic and as a response to the continued social distancing and lockdowns worldwide.

Said Griffin, “We are in a time of isolation but we can be deeply connected right now by that separation we feel by reaching out. It is important to understand that Oliveros’ opera is not a spectator’s opera, rather, it is a vast participatory operatic landscape of moondrunk people in a fictional space of free expression and listening.”

## Isolation Portraits I-III

Macumbista

At the start of April 2020, as cities around the world locked down in response to the Corona virus, I began asking people for images taken of themselves in isolation. My intention was to create a series of media archaeological portraits using scan processing and raster manipulation techniques from the 1970’s, realized with contemporary computer code, and rendered on a 1980’s vector video game display. Approximately 30 portraits were created in all, of which these are the first four.

Scan processing represents a crossover technique from early computer graphics in the 1960's to video synthesis in the 1970’s. Two famous scan processors are the Scanimate system and the Rutt/Etra video synthesizer used in the production of both commercial television graphics and works by artists such as Steina and Woody Vasulka, Gary Hill, and others. Similarly, Nam June Paik's Wobbulator demonstrated how the raster of the televised image can be manipulated by magnetic fields to reveal its absolutely artificial nature. As obsolete technology, scan processing represents the dreams, aspirations, and fears of the Cold War generation expressed through moving image. My approach to these portraits connects with the myriad selfie filters which members of the current generation use to express their own dreams, aspirations, and fears through social media.

## Sonic Graffiti in Digbeth

Mr. Underwood

I was recently commissioned by VIVID and Capsule to produce and install eight pieces of Sonic Graffiti in Digbeth, Birmingham. These are sound objects, embedded in the built environment.
